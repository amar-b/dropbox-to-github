# Dropbox to github
- Simple script that takes the current state of a public/private dropbox folder and commits it a repo hosted on github
- Assumes that the repo already exists
- Intention when writing this is so it can be used as a lambda function that can be triggered to an a schedule using a cron expression (via EventBridge) 

## Lambda deployment
### Package and deploy to aws
```Bash
./deploy.sh
```

### Secrets in aws
- Secrets are added in aws as env variables in the lambda configuration.
- Git access token expires every year. So env variable must be updated
  + https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Dropbox refresh token is generated using the auth code and authcoode is generated by calling /authorize with offline grant type
